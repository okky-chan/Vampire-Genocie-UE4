# Vampire-Genocie-UE4

My first game using UE(Unreal Engine) 4 called Vampire Genocie ðŸ¥°

Sorry if the video is too short, because if I play the game and then record it it will be lagging and the video size will be too big.

The concepts is you can kill all of vampires and find the easter eggs or you go directly to easter eggs, the inside of easter eggs is a video.

Below is the video:
